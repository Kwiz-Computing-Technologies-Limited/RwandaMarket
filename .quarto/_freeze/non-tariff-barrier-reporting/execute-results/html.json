They can include: - Complex customs procedures - Technical regulations and standards - Sanitary and phytosanitary measures - Licensing requirements - Quotas\n\nReporting and addressing NTBs is crucial for smooth cross-border trade operations.\n\n## NTB Reporting Form\n\nIf you encounter a non-tariff barrier, please report it using the form below:\n\n```{shinylive-r}\n#| standalone: true\nlibrary(shiny)\n\nui_nontariff <- fluidPage(\n  (\n    selectInput(\"barrier_type\", \"Type of Non-Tariff Barrier\", \n                choices = c(\"Customs Procedures\", \"Technical Regulations\", \"Sanitary Measures\", \"Licensing Requirements\", \"Other\")),\n    selectInput(\"country\", \"Country Where Barrier was Encountered\", \n              choices = c(\"Rwanda\", \"Kenya\", \"Uganda\", \"Tanzania\", \"Burundi\", \"South Sudan\")),\n    dateInput(\"date_encountered\", \"Date Encountered\"),\n    textAreaInput(\"barrier_description\", \"Detailed Description of the Barrier\"),\n    numericInput(\"estimated_cost\", \"Estimated Cost Impact (USD)\", value = 0),\n    textAreaInput(\"resolution_efforts\", \"Description of Resolution Efforts\"),\n    selectInput(\"status\", \"Current Status\", \n                choices = c(\"Unresolved\", \"In Progress\", \"Resolved\")),\n    actionButton(\"submit\", \"Submit Report\")\n  )\n)\n\nserver_nontariff <- function(input, output, session) {\n  observeEvent(input$submit, {\n    # In a real application, this would process and store the form data\n    showNotification(\"NTB report submitted successfully\", type = \"message\")\n  })\n}\n\nshinyApp(ui_nontariff, server_nontariff)\n```\n\n## NTB Analysis and Resolution\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](non-tariff-barrier-reporting_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nOur team regularly analyzes reported NTBs to: 1.
