## Company History and Background

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(ggplot2)

# Company timeline data
timeline_data <- data.frame(
  Year = c(2023, 2024, 2024, 2025, 2026),
  Event = c("Concept Development", "Company Founded", "E-commerce Launch", "Physical Store Opening", "B2B Services Expansion"),
  Milestone = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
)

# Create a timeline plot
ggplot(timeline_data, aes(x = Year, y = Milestone, label = Event)) +
  geom_point(color = "#7C4700", size = 5) +
  geom_text(vjust = -1, hjust = 0.5, size = 3.5) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "RwandaMarket Company Timeline", x = "Year", y = "") +
  theme(axis.text.y = element_blank(), axis.ticks.y = element_blank())
