We’ll use the paws library to interact with AWS and the mongolite library to interact with MongoDB.\nThis script does the following:\n\nSets up AWS credentials and initializes the DocumentDB client.\nCreates a DocumentDB cluster (which is MongoDB-compatible).\nWaits for the cluster to be available and retrieves its endpoint.\nConnects to the MongoDB database using the mongolite library.\nCreates collections for customers, business partners, products, and orders.\nDemonstrates how to insert a record and query the database.\n\nTo use this in production:\n\nReplace YOUR_AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, YOUR_AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY, YOUR_SECURE_PASSWORD, YOUR_SUBNET_GROUP, and YOUR_SECURITY_GROUP_ID with your actual AWS and network configuration details.\nEnsure that your AWS security group allows incoming connections on port 27017 from your application servers.\nImplement proper security measures, such as storing credentials securely and not in the code.\nSet up error handling and connection pooling for robustness.\nImplement functions to handle form submissions and database operations for each type of document we’re collecting.\n\nTo integrate this with the Quarto website:\n\nCreate API endpoints (e.g., using Plumber in R) that accept form submissions and interact with the database.\nModify the Shiny forms to submit to these API endpoints.\nImplement proper validation and error handling on both client and server sides.\n\nThis setup provides a scalable and flexible system for collecting and storing the various documents required for RwandaMarket’s operations. The use of MongoDB allows for easy storage of complex, nested documents, which is particularly useful for things like product catalogs and order information."
