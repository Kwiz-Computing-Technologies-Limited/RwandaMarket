### Revenue Projections

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(ggplot2)

# Revenue projection data
revenue_data <- data.frame(
  Year = 1:5,
  B2C_Revenue = c(600000, 1200000, 2000000, 3000000, 4000000),
  B2B_Revenue = c(200000, 400000, 500000, 1000000, 1500000)
)

# Create a stacked bar chart of revenue projections
ggplot(revenue_data, aes(x = Year)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = B2C_Revenue, fill = "B2C"), stat = "identity") +
  geom_bar(aes(y = B2B_Revenue, fill = "B2B"), stat = "identity") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("B2C" = "#7C4700", "B2B" = "#00A86B")) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Revenue Projections",
       y = "Revenue ($)",
       fill = "Revenue Stream") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma)
```

4. Cash Flow Management
   - Mitigation: Conservative cash flow projections and maintaining a cash reserve

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(ggplot2)

# Financial metrics data
metrics_data <- data.frame(
  Metric = c("Gross Margin", "Net Profit Margin", "Customer Acquisition Cost", "Lifetime Value"),
  Year_1 = c(40, -5, 50, 150),
  Year_3 = c(45, 10, 40, 200)
)

# Reshape data for plotting
metrics_long <- tidyr::pivot_longer(metrics_data, cols = c(Year_1, Year_3), names_to = "Year", values_to = "Value")

# Create a grouped bar chart
ggplot(metrics_long, aes(x = Metric, y = Value, fill = Year)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = "dodge") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Key Financial Metrics Comparison",
       x = "",
       y = "Value ($/%)",
       fill = "Year") +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("Year_1" = "#7C4700", "Year_3" = "#00A86B")) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```
