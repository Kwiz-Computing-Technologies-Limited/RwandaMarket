e_commerce <- c(26.5, 33.3, 39.6, 46.1, 56)

handicrafts <- c(0.5, 0.58, 0.66, 0.76, 0.88)  # Hypothetical data for Rwandan handicrafts in billion USD

market_data <- data.frame(Year = rep(years, 4),
                          Size = c(e_commerce, coffee, tea, handicrafts),
                          Category = rep(c("E-commerce", "Coffee", "Tea", "Handicrafts"), each = 5))

ggplot(market_data, aes(x = Year, y = Size, color = Category)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.5) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  labs(title = "Market Growth Projections",
       subtitle = "Overall E-commerce and Key Rwandan Product Categories",
       y = "Market Size (Billion USD)") +

                     breaks = c(0.1, 1, 10, 100),
                     labels = c("0.1", "1", "10", "100"))

```

This graph illustrates the projected growth of the overall African e-commerce market alongside the specific product categories that RwandaMarket focuses on. While the scale of the specialty product markets is smaller, their growth rates are significant, presenting substantial opportunities for niche e-commerce platforms like RwandaMarket.

The rapid growth in both the overall e-commerce market and the specific product categories that RwandaMarket specializes in, coupled with the identified market trends, indicates a favorable environment for the company's expansion. The increasing demand for premium, culturally significant, and sustainably produced products from Rwanda in the broader East African market, particularly in Kenya, suggests a strong potential for RwandaMarket's unique offering.

By leveraging these trends and focusing on high-quality, authentic Rwandan products, RwandaMarket is well-positioned to capture a significant share of the growing e-commerce market in East Africa.
