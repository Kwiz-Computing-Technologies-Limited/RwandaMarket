## Understanding Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs)

Non-Tariff Barriers are obstacles to trade that are not in the form of a tariff. They can include: - Complex customs procedures - Technical regulations and standards - Sanitary and phytosanitary measures - Licensing requirements - Quotas

Reporting and addressing NTBs is crucial for smooth cross-border trade operations.

## NTB Reporting Form

If you encounter a non-tariff barrier, please report it using the form below:

```{shinylive-r}
#| standalone: true
library(shiny)

ui <- fluidPage(
  bslib::card(
    selectInput("barrier_type", "Type of Non-Tariff Barrier", 
                choices = c("Customs Procedures", "Technical Regulations", "Sanitary Measures", "Licensing Requirements", "Other")),
    selectInput("country", "Country Where Barrier was Encountered", 
              choices = c("Rwanda", "Kenya", "Uganda", "Tanzania", "Burundi", "South Sudan")),
    dateInput("date_encountered", "Date Encountered"),
    textAreaInput("barrier_description", "Detailed Description of the Barrier"),
    numericInput("estimated_cost", "Estimated Cost Impact (USD)", value = 0),
    textAreaInput("resolution_efforts", "Description of Resolution Efforts"),
    selectInput("status", "Current Status", 
                choices = c("Unresolved", "In Progress", "Resolved")),
    actionButton("submit", "Submit Report")
  )
)

server <- function(input, output, session) {
  observeEvent(input$submit, {
    # In a real application, this would process and store the form data
    showNotification("NTB report submitted successfully", type = "message")
  })
}

shinyApp(ui, server)
```

## NTB Analysis and Resolution

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(ggplot2)

# Sample data for illustration
ntb_data <- data.frame(
  Barrier_Type = c("Customs Procedures", "Technical Regulations", "Sanitary Measures", "Licensing Requirements", "Other"),
  Frequency = c(40, 25, 15, 12, 8)
)

ggplot(ntb_data, aes(x = reorder(Barrier_Type, -Frequency), y = Frequency)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#FFA500") +
  labs(title = "Frequency of Non-Tariff Barriers by Type",
       x = "Barrier Type",
       y = "Frequency") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))
```

Our team regularly analyzes reported NTBs to: 1. Identify patterns and recurring issues 2. Develop strategies for overcoming common barriers 3. Engage with relevant authorities to address systemic problems 4. Provide guidance to our partners on navigating complex regulations
