## Current Supply Chain Overview

RwandaMarket's supply chain spans from artisan workshops in Rwanda to customers in Kenya, involving multiple touchpoints and stakeholders.

## Key Optimization Areas

1. Sourcing and Procurement
2. Inventory Management
3. Warehousing
4. Transportation and Logistics
5. Last-Mile Delivery

## Data-Driven Optimization Strategies

### Demand Forecasting

Using historical sales data and machine learning algorithms to predict future demand.

```{r}
#| echo: false
library(ggplot2)

set.seed(123)
dates <- seq(as.Date("2023-01-01"), as.Date("2023-12-31"), by = "day")
sales <- cumsum(rnorm(365, mean = 5, sd = 2))
forecast <- sales + rnorm(365, mean = 0, sd = 10)

sales_data <- data.frame(Date = dates, Sales = sales, Forecast = forecast)

ggplot(sales_data, aes(x = Date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Sales, color = "Actual Sales")) +
  geom_line(aes(y = Forecast, color = "Forecast"), linetype = "dashed") +
  labs(title = "Sales Forecast vs Actual Sales",
       y = "Sales Volume") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Actual Sales" = "#00A86B", "Forecast" = "#FFA500")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Inventory Optimization

Implementing a Just-in-Time (JIT) inventory system to reduce holding costs while ensuring product availability.

### Route Optimization

Using algorithms to determine the most efficient delivery routes, reducing transportation costs and delivery times.

## Performance Metrics

- Order Fulfillment Rate
- Inventory Turnover Ratio
- On-Time Delivery Rate
- Supply Chain Cycle Time

## Technology Integration

- IoT devices for real-time tracking
