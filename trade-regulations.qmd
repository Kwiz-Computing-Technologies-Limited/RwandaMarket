#| echo: false
library(ggplot2)

# Regulation complexity data
regulation_data <- data.frame(
  Product_Category = c("Coffee & Tea", "Handicrafts", "Textiles", "Jewelry", "Art"),
  Regulation_Complexity = c(8, 6, 7, 5, 9)
)

# Create a horizontal bar chart of regulation complexity
ggplot(regulation_data, aes(x = Regulation_Complexity, y = reorder(Product_Category, Regulation_Complexity))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#7C4700") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Regulation Complexity by Product Category",
       x = "Complexity Score (1-10)",
       y = "") +
