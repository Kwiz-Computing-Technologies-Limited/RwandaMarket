Understanding the trade regulations governing commerce between Rwanda and Kenya is crucial for successful cross-border operations. RwandaMarket is committed to ensuring full compliance with all relevant laws and treaties.

## Key Trade Agreements

### 1. East African Community (EAC) Customs Union

The EAC Customs Union, which includes both Rwanda and Kenya, provides for:

-   Duty-free movement of goods within the EAC
-   Common External Tariff (CET) for goods imported from outside the EAC
-   Harmonized customs procedures

### 2. African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA)

Both Rwanda and Kenya are signatories to the AfCFTA, which aims to create a single continental market for goods and services.

## Import/Export Procedures

### Documentation Required

1.  Commercial Invoice
2.  Packing List
3.  Certificate of Origin
4.  Bill of Lading/Airway Bill
5.  Import Declaration Form (IDF)
6.  Pre-Export Verification of Conformity (PVoC)

# Regulation complexity data
regulation_data <- data.frame(
  Product_Category = c("Coffee & Tea", "Handicrafts", "Textiles", "Jewelry", "Art"),
  Regulation_Complexity = c(8, 6, 7, 5, 9)
)

# Create a horizontal bar chart of regulation complexity
ggplot(regulation_data, aes(x = Regulation_Complexity, y = reorder(Product_Category, Regulation_Complexity))) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "#7C4700") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Regulation Complexity by Product Category",
       x = "Complexity Score (1-10)",
       y = "") +
  geom_text(aes(label = Regulation_Complexity), hjust = -0.5)
```

## Tariffs and Taxes

-   Value Added Tax (VAT): 16% in Kenya
